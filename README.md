# WorldInVenom

"A world in venom" is an open world exploration game where you can gather various resources and items from a procedurally generated world. 

At the start of the game, the world is generated, which includes terrain, foliage and towns. The towns are also populated with families, members of which come in both genders and multiple races. Families also share a surname, and their home is labelled as theirs. The inhabitants of the world also have different appointments around town - they have to buy things at the general store, visit neighbours and get water from the town well. The latter of these might be interesting to you, if you wanted for something interesting to happen in your town. 

I should emphasis here that in this game you really are a monster - Not the fictional spooky scary under-the-bed kind, the real kind. A thing you can do is poison the town well. Visitors to the well will begin to get ill and eventually die. 

There are several different items you can collect in the world and you can store them in the nifty inventory system. The whole of the game also has tooltips to make it easier to see what is what. 

Oh! I also wrote a score for the game. :D I'll let you decide how great it is :D (Spoiler: It's pretty great :DDDD) 

Instructions are in-game. 

If possible, I encourage you to leave a written comment down below. While I appreciate numeric ratings, I enjoy written reviews a lot more. Thanks!
